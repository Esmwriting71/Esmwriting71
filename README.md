--->Hi, I'm @Esmwriting71 and am new to coding. 
    Currently, I'm studying AI and trying to learn Python. 
    I'm an observer at first (a lil shy in code world) as my internet expererience has mostly been
    in utilizing the English language to navigate algorithms. Now, I want to learn coding language.
    I can be reached at esmwriting@gmail.com
